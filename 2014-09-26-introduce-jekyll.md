Jekyll is simple static site generator. It's concise, therefore, it's suitable for a lazy boy like me. Comparing with WordPress, Jekyll is lightweight. You can check all the files in your home directory and see what they are used for. It's nice for a slight OCD programmer. You can learn the Jekyll structure at it's [documentation][jekyll-structure]. Another benefit of using Jekyll is [GitHub Pages][github-pages]! This is the root cause of using Jekyll for me. It means I can update my blog using Git which is frequently used in my working. And benefiting form Github, deploying Jekyll to Github Pages is free. I do not need to pay for a rarely used web server anymore, hooray!

I wanted to add some music in my posts, so I tried xiami widget. It was unexpected easy to use. Just insert the JavaScript widget in the post and the Markdown preprocessor won't touch it. Cool!

Maybe I will update this post for usage of Jekyll later on. If so, I will embed Github Gists. It's so convenient.
